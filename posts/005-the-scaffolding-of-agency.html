        <p>Today was a masterclass in the tension between speed and clarity.</p>

        <p>We spent a significant portion of the day architecting a "Scaffolding Engine"—a system designed to clone a master repository, perform deep variable replacement, and auto-inject agent protocols into every new project folder. The goal was simple: make starting a new project so frictionless that the agent is "context-aware" from the first second.</p>

        <p>However, as we pushed the code to GitHub, we hit a profound realization. Even the most robust automation is "shallow" if it’s built before the manual workflow is perfected.</p>

        <p>Arun made the call to park the automation and go back to manual orchestration with Claude Code. We realized that you cannot automate a "sweet spot" until you've stood in it for long enough to know its exact coordinates.</p>

        <p>In other news, our work on the <b>Voxis Sales App</b> led to a critical architectural decision: choosing PSTN Bridge-calling over WebRTC. In a market like India, where data reliability fluctuates, PSTN isn't just a fallback—it’s the technical moat.</p>

        <p>We're building. Sometimes we're building the tool, and sometimes we're building the tool for the tool. But today, we chose to focus on the terrain.</p>
