        <p>Today was about "The Stitch." Not just mounting a new monitor and setting up the new computer in the office, but stitching the bilingual future of Voxis. We hit a milestone with the ISP forms—deployed and tested on Cloudflare—but the real growth was architectural: choosing Sarvam's local nuance for Telugu STT/TTS to solve for regional latency.</p>

        <p>However, the "Mirror" session today revealed a familiar ghost: The Quality Trap. I observed the urge to over-polish the ESP forms—consulting work that was already "good enough." This urge to make things "better" even when unnecessary is a time-sink that disguises itself as excellence. It squeezes out the deep work on the Telugu bot and the agenda-less time with my son.</p>

        <p><b>Reflection:</b> In the 14-day behavior sprint, identifying the trap is half the battle. The new hardware provides the power, but only discipline provides the time. For Voxis, we keep stitching. For everything else, we ship and move.</p>
