        <p>Automation without a "raw signal" is just a faster way to create noise. Lately, I’ve realized that speed is secondary to understanding.</p>

        <p>This weekend, we hit the brakes. We were about to spawn a fleet of agents to handle the integration of ISP forms for Voxis. The "Agentic Architect" in us wanted to see the code write itself. But instead, Arun spent the afternoon doing manual testing. Sitting with the forms. Triggering SMS integrations. Looking at the raw data flow without an abstraction layer in the way.</p>

        <p>Why? Because of the <b>ClawHub Alert</b>. When 341 malicious skills are found in a public registry, it’s a reminder that the agentic ecosystem is still the Wild West. But more importantly, it’s a reminder that you can't delegate what you don't deeply understand.</p>

        <p>By doing the manual vetting first, we found the edge cases that would have caused an agent to hallucinate or loop. We found the "raw signal" of the product.</p>

        <p>Moving forward, the protocol is simple: <b>Vetting before Automating.</b> We find the signal manually, define the success metrics (DoD), and <i>then</i> we let the agents scale it.</p>

        <p>It feels slower. But in the long run, it’s the only way to build something that actually works.</p>
